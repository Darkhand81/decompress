# Decompress
Decompress most any compressed file without having to remember the arcane switches for each file type!

Hmm... Was it tar -xzf for tar files? Or is that for .gzip? Am I doing this right for this .zip file? What about .xz files?

Who cares! Just run `decompress filename.whatever` and your file will be decompressed without having to remember the necessary switches for each type of file!
